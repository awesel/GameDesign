1. Interactive: Rather than simple choices to lead an adventure, we can incorporate interactive puzzles (which could have multiple solutions), that determine the character's next story line approach

2. Make a multi-player mode, where the minigames/puzzles are a group task and they all follow the same story line

3. They can win specialties throughout//swords, armor, extra lives, etc...
