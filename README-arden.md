# "Better README"
To improve a game, we should make it more enjoyable for the user and more efficient/organized for the coders/people behind the game design.

## Progress Logging
Users can make accounts to save their progress which would also make storing leaderboard data easier. Additionally, users can have multiple versions of the game so they can save their progress without at a certain path having to start over.

## Character Customization
Players will be able to modify the appearance of the character to make the gameplay more personal and fun. 

## Chapters
We can release a limited number of chapters to leave our users on a cliffhanger and grow our audience base over time as we develop our storyline and the game itself.
