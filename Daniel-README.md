# 1 Monetization ðŸ’° ðŸ¤‘

- **Redo**
  If there is an undesiereable ending (the user dies), the user has the option to watch a monetized advertisement to revert to a previous point in the game.

- **Subscription Services with Exclusive Content:** Implement a subscription-based model offering players exclusive in-game content, such as special outfits, weapons. Microtransactions would be purely cosmetic.

- **Premium Storylines:**
  Offer additional story arcs or premium storylines as in-app purchases. Players can access these new adventures, which could be separate from the main storyline, offering fresh characters, settings, and choices. These could be marketed as expansions or side quests, providing extended playtime for enthusiasts.
