# 1 Monetization 💰 🤑

- **Redo**
  If there is an undesiereable ending (the user dies), the user has the option to watch a monetized advertisement to revert to a previous point in the game. Unlock tokens?

- **Subscription Services with Exclusive Content:** Implement a subscription-based model offering players exclusive in-game content, such as special outfits, weapons. Microtransactions would be purely cosmetic.

- **Premium Storylines:**
  Offer additional story arcs or premium storylines as in-app purchases. Players can access these new adventures, which could be separate from the main storyline, offering fresh characters, settings, and choices. These could be marketed as expansions or side quests, providing extended playtime for enthusiasts.

# 2 Community Engagement and Interactivity 🌍

- **Player-Created Scenarios:** Introduce a feature where players can design their own branching stories and choices, which can be shared or sold within the game’s marketplace. Players can browse and purchase user-created content, providing an additional revenue stream for both the developers and creative players.

- **Limited-Time Cooperative Stories:** Design cooperative story experiences where multiple players can collaborate and make decisions together in real-time. Offering these multiplayer experiences as time-limited events or in-app purchases can create a social gaming dynamic and add an element of urgency for players to join in during these events.

# 3 Mini-Games / Side Objectives 🎮

- **Time-based Challenges:** Implement timed challenges that test players' speed and reflexes. These could involve escaping from hazardous situations within a specific time limit.

- **Character Quests:** Offer side quests that delve into the backstories of supporting characters, allowing players to learn more about their motivations or history. These quests could involve assisting or teaming up with other characters.
