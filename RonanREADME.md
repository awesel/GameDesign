Improvements

Make tree paths that can converge later on or set back to other story lines possibly "soft" reseting a lot of story you have gone through. Make some choices so impactful they may create a branch so different from others that nothing converges with it, giving many unique endings.

Add multiplayer branches that require a second player to do a certain choice/make it past a certain part of the story, so some endings may be locked in a singleplayer format but it encourages crossplay with friends to enjoy new branches together.

Add customizable features, such as things unlocked by finishing certain paths, or if you go one way if you redo the story differnt paths would be unlocked.
