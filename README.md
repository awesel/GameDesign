"better" -

## Introduction

The game is is an RPG modeled off of the choose your own adventure story Journey Under the Sea by R.A. Montgomery. There is a PDF of the story in this repo. The game will be visually similar to Cuphead and the gameplay will be similar to the Henry Stickmin franchise.
However, after each choice the player will be subject to a short puzzle or minigame.

## Value

The game has an engaging story and interactive minigames and boss fights throughout.

## User Experience

The game is primarily single player. The graphics are 2d, but animated in a lively manner. Similar to Cuphead.

There are also multiplayer campaigns and stories. Groups of up to 4 players can enter a story together and complete minigames together. These games and boss fights will be tweaked to accomodate the increased number of players. They can communicate via in-game voice and text chats. Story choices will be decided with votes.

Boss fights and other "combat" minigames can include platformer shooters (probably optimal given 2D nature), scroll shooters, bullet-hell/shoot-em-up.

## Competitive Element

There will be various "speedrun" leaderboards, documenting how fast people can achieve each ending, as well as discovering the entire tree of endings.

Multiplayer story lines and minigames can be added. What choice to continue with will be decided by a group vote. Each players' contribution can be counted in points for each minigame & a total can be generated at the ending.

Special achievements can garner special cosmetics or effects (see Scalability).

## Addictiveness Strategy

Just like the Henry Stickmin games that were very popular throughout my earlier childhood, once beginning the game and being introduced to the wacky mechanics, one's innate curiousity compels them to continue exploring all the endings.

Hidden achievements and easter eggs scattered throughout each storyline can also pique players' curiousity.

## Scalability

There are hundreds of choose your own adventure stories. This game can be followed up with many sequels, or the tree can be expanded to incorporate other endings.

Customizable characters & cosmetics offer an avenue to monetization and more features.

There can also be a stats system similar to DnD or Fallout. This can impact the development of the story and how you play certain minigames/bossfights

## California Non-Discrimination Clause Statement

The game will include a colorblind setting which adds a filter to make everything visible to people who are colorblind. There will also be optional narration, which describes what is happening on screen, for those who are blind. Nobody will be harassed or discriminated against during production.

Customizable controls & playstyles can be implemented. There can be a game mode that is purely plot and choice based, without minigames, for casual players.
