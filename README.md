"better" (focused on interactive design)

- The design is more intuitive and accessible on the user. Users should quickly and easily understand how to interact with the game. Convienience, such as accessibility on all devices, is also key. At the same time, the game behaves exactly as the developers planned and there will be no need to sacrifice features to make up for a lack of convienience.

## Introduction

The game is is an RPG modeled off of the choose your own adventure story Journey Under the Sea by R.A. Montgomery. There is a PDF of the story in this repo. The game will be visually similar to Cuphead and the gameplay will be similar to the Henry Stickmin franchise.
However, after each choice the player will be subject to a short puzzle or minigame.

Ideally, the story can reach a satisfying ending regardless of which choice the player makes, but some choices will definitely be better than others and others may lead to minigames that require more skill to pass.

## Value

The game has an engaging story and interactive minigames and boss fights throughout.

Simple controls and saved progress means the player can pick up from where they left off at anytime on any device.

## User Experience

The game is primarily single player. The graphics are 2d, but animated in a lively manner. Similar to Cuphead.

There are also multiplayer campaigns and stories. Groups of up to 4 players can enter a story together and complete minigames together. These games and boss fights will be tweaked to accomodate the increased number of players. They can communicate via in-game voice and text chats. Story choices will be decided with votes.

Boss fights and other "combat" minigames can include platformer shooters (probably optimal given 2D nature), scroll shooters, bullet-hell/shoot-em-up.

Small minigames can include pattern recognition, matching shapes, looking for hidden pieces, quicktime events, etc...

Everything should be controllable with 2-or-less fingers or just a keyboard.

## Competitive Element

There will be various "speedrun" leaderboards, documenting how fast people can achieve each ending, as well as discovering the entire tree of endings.

Multiplayer story lines and minigames can be added. What choice to continue with will be decided by a group vote. Each players' contribution can be counted in points for each minigame & a total can be generated at the ending.

Special achievements can garner special cosmetics or effects (see Scalability).

## Addictiveness Strategy

Just like the Henry Stickmin games that were very popular throughout my earlier childhood, once beginning the game and being introduced to the wacky mechanics, one's innate curiousity compels them to continue exploring all the endings.

Hidden achievements and easter eggs scattered throughout each storyline can also pique players' curiousity.

A system I really liked in one game I play often are "artifacts." These provide various buffs, debuffs, utility, unlock different storylines, etc... This greatly encourages replaying the same campaign to try out different strategies.

## Scalability

There are hundreds of choose your own adventure stories. This game can be followed up with many sequels, or the tree can be expanded to incorporate other endings.

Customizable characters & cosmetics offer an avenue to monetization and more features.

There can also be a stats system similar to DnD or Fallout. This further increases personalizing your character. Now your characters' build can impact the development of the story and how you play certain minigames/bossfights.

## California Non-Discrimination Clause Statement

The game will include a colorblind setting which adds a filter to make everything visible to people who are colorblind. There will also be optional narration, which describes what is happening on screen, for those who are blind. Nobody will be harassed or discriminated against during production.

Customizable controls & playstyles can be implemented. There can be a game mode that is purely plot and choice based, without minigames, for casual players.

Difficulty settings that will impact the difficulty of minigames will also be added.

## ******************************\_******************************

1. Interactive: Rather than simple choices to lead an adventure, we can incorporate interactive puzzles (which could have multiple solutions), that determine the character's next story line approach

Controls need to be as simplistic as possible. Optimally, one can be able to play this with 2 fingers on their phone.

Boss fights and other "combat" minigames can include platformer shooters (probably optimal given 2D nature), scroll shooters, bullet-hell/shoot-em-up.
Small minigames / puzzles can include pattern recognition, matching shapes, looking for hidden pieces, quicktime events, etc...
The results of these minigames will impact the rest of the storyline.
E.g. time taken to beat; hp remaining; how successful you were in accomplishing the objective;

2. Make a multiplayer mode, where the minigames/puzzles are a group task and they all follow the same story line certain storylines can only be played by two+ players so you can unlock every ending with other people.

They can communicate via in-game voice and text chats. Story choices will be decided with votes.

3. They can pick up artifacts throughout the story//swords, armor, extra lives, etc…
   These provide various buffs, debuffs, utility, unlock different storylines, etc... This greatly encourages replaying the same campaign to try out different strategies.

There can also be a stats system similar to DnD or Fallout. The artifacts will impact this stat system and help quantify the effects. This further increases personalizing your character. Now your characters' build can impact the development of the story and how you play certain minigames/boss fights.

4. How to make money

What we should do is offer 2 different types of currency: one, coins, 2, rubies. The coins are things you can get from in game and from watching ads, etc. But the rubies are the things you can get from actually spending money. The rubies can give you lives, skins, etc.

5. We should have music - different music for each level / story path.

6. I think it could be cool if we make the background images/ world a realistic HW - or a pixelated HW as well.

7. Addictiveness

Making the game live multiplayer if 2 players want to have similar stories.

Similar to Markiplier, add one "true" ending - make it really hard to find

Incorporate components from other RPGs (ex. Minecraft StoryBook, MK11 etc.) rather than just cup pong

7. Anti-discrimination / Accessibility
   Customizable controls & playstyles can be implemented. There can be a game mode that is purely plot and choice based, without minigames, for casual players.

Difficulty settings that will impact the difficulty of minigames will also be added.

8. GROUP CHAT ON THE GAME

   Global chat like on clash of clans - have to make sure there’s no bullying
