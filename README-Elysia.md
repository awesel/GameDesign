1. Adventure similar to The Lego Movie, game of running to escape from bad guys to save the word with a "key"-- can choose your partner, choose your transportation- motorcycle, batmobile- How you want to build your lego character- with a hat, what pants, shirt, etc. - what pet/sidekick you want
2. A bigger version of Plants vs. Zombies combined with ZombieLand, a choose your own adventure with killing and trying to escape zombies, and big, scary plant characters-- what weapon do you choose? do you choose to team up with certain people?- or kill certain people- do you choose to hide in certain places? Do you want a pet to hang out with? Or are you trying to reach a certain Safe Haven maybe?

3) Live the life of your fav celeb, You can pick any celeb you want-- we'll have choices and you can live a life with their family-- pick a new house, vacations, job, if you wanna be in a movie or become a boxer- if you wanna volunteer, etc. Basically Sim City/Roblox - like build your own house or something but with skins of famous ppl.

- Create something with more choices- a theme multiple people would want to play- not something hard to understand or too wordy but something fun and pleasing to actually look at
