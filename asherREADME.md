## Introduction

The game is is an RPG modeled off of the choose your own adventure story Journey Under the Sea by R.A. Montgomery. There is a PDF of the story in this repo. The game will be visually similar to Cuphead and the gameplay will be similar to the Henry Stickmin franchise.

## Value

The game has an engaging story and interactive minigames and boss fights throughout.

## User Experience

The game is single player. The graphics are 2d, but animated in a lively manner. Similar to Cuphead.

## Competitive Element

There will be various "speedrun" leaderboards, documenting how fast people can achieve each ending, as well as discovering the entire tree of endings.

## Addictiveness Strategy

Just like the Henry Stickmin games that were very popular throughout my earlier childhood, once beginning the game and being introduced to the wacky mechanics, one's innate curiousity compels them to continue exploring all the endings.

## Scalability

There are hundreds of choose your own adventure stories. This game can be followed up with many sequels, or the tree can be expanded to incorporate other endings.

## California Non-Discrimination Clause Statement

The game will include a colorblind setting which adds a filter to make everything visible to people who are colorblind. There will also be optional narration, which describes what is happening on screen, for those who are blind. Nobody will be harassed or discriminated against during production.

## How to make money

What we should do is offer 2 different types of currency: one, coins, 2, rubies. The coins are things you can get from in game and from watching ads, etc. But the rubies are the things you can get from actually spending money. The rubies can give you lives, skins, etc.
